# Feature_engineering_EDA

This project focuses on the analysis of data on the chemistry of arable soils in Poland in 2020, using advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering techniques. The project involves the processing and analysis of data downloaded from the dane.gov.pl website, where a variety of soil monitoring datasets are available.

The project included:
- Feature Engineering (FE) - preparing the data for modelling, with comments on the methods used.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - detailed data analysis, selection and justification of techniques used.
- First stages of ML pipeline construction - selection of target variable (TARGET) and set of variables (FEATURES) potentially useful for modelling, with justification.
